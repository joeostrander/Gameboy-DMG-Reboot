# Gameboy DMG Reboot

## Description
This is a Gameboy that you can essentially make without using any original DMG parts.

I made this late 2022 but there didn's seem to be much interest, so I never published any files.
Now it's later in the year and I see there is a similar project released so I figured I'd share too :)
